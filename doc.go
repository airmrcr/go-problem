// Package problem provides support for generating "problem details" in accordance to RFC 9457
// https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457, represented as a Problem. A Generator can be used to control a lot of
// the logic applied when generating problems. When not specified, DefaultGenerator, the zero value of Generator, is
// used where appropriate.
//
// While a Problem can be created manually by populating fields, this is not the intended approach will result in many
// of the controls offered by Generator being lost. Instead a Problem is constructed using either Build or New with
// options. Both are the same as the latter uses a Builder under-the-hood, so the only real difference is syntax.
//
// A Problem is an error and, as such, can wrap another error and can be wrapped. Wrap (and Builder.Wrap) can be used
// for wrapped while As and Is can be used for unwrapping.
//
// The package also provides opt-in support for stack trace capturing and UUID generation for problems along with the
// concept of a problem Code.
