// Package http provides built-in reusable a problem.Definition and problem.Type for each known HTTP error. While
// problem generators are encouraged to define their own types etc., this package can make it easier for a generator to
// start utilizing problems, especially for those acting as gateways.
//
// All definitions and types have translation keys assigned so that their details and titles can be localized
// respectively. However, none of the types have a URI reference as these should be specific for each generation. As
// such, unless specified during problem construction, these will fall back to problem.DefaultTypeURI.
